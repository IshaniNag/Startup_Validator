# Startup_Validator

The tool is designed to perform multiple validation tasks automatically using backend logic
and AI-powered libraries. 
The high-level goals of the system are:
  ● To analyze a user’s startup idea written in plain text using NLP techniques.
  ● To extract relevant keywords and concepts to understand the thematic scope of the idea.
  ● To assess the emotional tone and intent through sentiment analysis.
  ● To simulate a market trend score based on keyword popularity and usage in similar domains.
  ● To find similar existing startups using contextual matching.
  ● To assign a comprehensive validation score to the idea, based on multiple internal metrics.
  ● To recommend a suitable tech stack and MVP development approach based on the domain.
  ● To suggest improvements and red flags if the idea appears unviable.
  ● To allow the user to download a detailed PDF report for future use, presentation, or revision.
